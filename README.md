## Marks Out

A simple Python script that polls the UPnet portal to retrieve marks using Selenium webdriver.
Once a new mark has been released then an email is sent out to students signed up for alerts.


### Usage

Replace empty strings in the script with the corresponding account details respective of the variable names.
Add emails to the list of Alert Emails.
Run the script in the background and wait for marks to be released.

### Where to from here?

Create a Django frontend with a user account system for users to sign up and get notified when marks are released.
A balancing system will be needed to pol maximum subjects with minimum poles for a more efficient system.
